Abstract:
In face recognition tasks with a single training sample, nearest neighbor class is one of the famous methods
The idea is the simplicity of implementation. Choosing the right distance measurement criteria in these issues due to the effects of light and
Other photography issues should be done with more accuracy because traditional methods such as Euclidean distance are of good accuracy
do not have In this paper, a measure of dissimilarity or distance was introduced. Training and test samples in the form of patches
The introduced distance criterion was applied to these patches from the segments of each photo. Finally, the accuracy is class
The nearest neighbor was calculated.
